# Swift_palette

SwiftUI app for mobile devices (IPhones) that provides insight into posibilities of rarely used controls such as linear controllers, color manipulation and icon display.

## Features

The project features main menu and four pages with following subject:

- color picker - changes the background color of the current page to the colour selected by the user using color palette,
- sliders and linear controllers - page that contains the indicators (tyhe elements that presents values graphocally) and editors (that lets user change the value selected by the user), the editors can chenge the value in different rate based on the slider or editor used,
- icons - presents the possibility of the IOS icons display from the color selection (in the example it id green) to the width of the stroke that icon uses and the selected base icon image style is used (icon that is displayed), the icons are displayed in rows,
- gradients - demonstrates the possibility of using the mask to change the base colous of every element displayed on the page that mask is hold of. The colour that mask applies is the gradient that consisits of seven colors, also the mask applies the effect to the text and the icons.

## Installation
